Hired or not 

SHape of the date === 1155 rows and 30 columns!!!! 

Framework for Machine learning projects!!!! 

CRSIP-ML(Q) 

Stages or phases? 

6

1. Business and data Understanding 

-1 to +1 

>0.85 --- Strong
>0.4 and <0.85 -- Moderate 
<0.4 --- Weak 

Distribution of the data -- Histogram 
Types of distributrion ---3 

Normal distribution
Left Skewed data
Right Skewed data 

Outliers in the data -- Box plot!!!! 

I want to see my catgorical columns --- Count plot!!! 

Correlation between the numerical columns --- Heat Map 

We can't check the correalation for the categorical columns!!! 

data preprocessing steps:
1. Handling of the Dupliactes!!!!
2. Handling of the Null values
3. handling of the outliers
4. Feature Scaling --- Numerical Columns 
5. Encoding of the data --- Categorical Columns 
6. Feature Engineering 

Missing values!!! 
Mean
median
Mode
Interploation = interpolate(method = "linear") 
Ffill 
Bfill

fillna()
fillna(methid ='ffill") 


Outliers!!!! 

3 types
1.Z-score!!!! when the data is Normally distributed!!!!
-3 to +3 
X-mean / STandard Deviation

it is used to REMOVE THE Outliers in the data!!!! 


IQR method 

Inter Quartile Range!!!

IQR = Q3-Q1 
describe()

It is also used to remove the Outliers!!
Lower Boundary === Q1-1.5*IQR
Upper Boundary === Q3+1.5*IQR 

Based upon the boundaries we will be removing the outliers!!!!

3. Capping Technique -- Winsorization!!!!-- Retain the Outliers!!!! 

Lower boundary -- 0.05 -- 5th Percentile 
Upper boundary -- 0.95 -- 95th Percentile 


Feature SCaling!!!! 

Numerical Columns!!!!


sir can you please explain the code for this hyperparameter tuning method?

3

STandard SCalar  === -3 to +3
Min Max SCalar === 0 to 1 
Robust Scalar == -1 to +1 

Encoding of the data

Label Encoder 
One-Hot  

Feature Engineering!!!!! -- Correlation or the heatMap 

Data Preprocessing steps are done!!!! 

Train and Test Split of the data!!!

80:20 or 70:30 respectively!!!!

Train will be 80 or 70 
Test will be 20 or 30 

Sir do we need to perform all the steps of data preprocessing for every model we make either it is classification or regression?

YES!!!!!!!!!

Model Building Phase!!!! 


Supervised learning -- Classification Models
Logistic Regression
KNN
SVM
Decision Tree
Random Forest

Model EValuation Metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
F1-Score
recall

Classification Report!!!!!! 

75%

Hyperparameter Tuning!!!! 
2 
Gridsearch CV 
Randomized Search CV 


can you explain cross validation

sir can you please explain the code for this hyperparameter tuning method?

how to select feature which categorical? -- dtypes!!!! 

You are going to build the model using Default parameters!!!


You are not satified with the results!!!!


You are asking the model that based upon the data can you helpme with the BEST parameters so that I will use them and best accuracy!!!


how one hour will be sufficient for a complete project on ML sir. this should have been more

sir sometimes i get confused which outlier technique to go with  can you tell when to use which one

can you explain overfitting and underfitting  concepts


Z-Score --- WHen your entire Numerical data is ND
IQR -- When your entire numerical columns data is Not Normally DIstributed 

Winsorization -- We will not remove the outliers whether your data is ND or not 

can you explain overfitting and underfitting concepts


overfitting === When your Train accuracy is Less and Test accuracy is High 

T-Shirt -- M === Trained with M Size!!!! 

Test -  M but when you wear it is LOOSE !!!!!

Underfitting ---- when your Train Accuracy is High and Test is Low
